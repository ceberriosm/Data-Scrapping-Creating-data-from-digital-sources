# Data-Scrapping-Creating-data-from-digital-sources

I selected the Apple Music top 100 playlists from different countries because I was curious to explore the cultural variations in music preferences across regions. By comparing these playlists, I aimed to identify common trends in popular songs as well as uncover unique regional music tastes. I wanted to understand if there were any songs that consistently appeared across multiple playlists, indicating their widespread popularity regardless of geographical boundaries. Additionally, I was interested in observing any distinct patterns or genres that dominated specific countriesâ€™ playlists, which could provide insights into the local music scenes and cultural influences.

# Final Reflection
I learned the importance of leveraging various digital sources to collect and create meaningful datasets. One important idea that stood out to me was the power of web scraping in extracting data from websites and online platforms. This technique allowed me to programmatically collect data that would have been otherwise time-consuming or challenging to obtain manually. By utilizing tools like rvest in R, I gained the ability to scrape and parse data from HTML pages, opening up a wide range of possibilities for data collection and analysis.

Reflecting on my learning across all the projects in the course, I am amazed at how much I have grown in my data analysis skills and technical abilities. I learned valuable techniques for data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization using R and various packages like dplyr, ggplot2, and tidyr. The projects provided hands-on experience in working with real-world datasets, allowing me to apply statistical techniques and explore patterns and insights.

As I move forward, I am curious to learn more about advanced topics such as machine learning and predictive modeling. I am intrigued by the potential of using algorithms and models to uncover hidden patterns and make predictions based on data. Additionally, I would like to delve deeper into data storytelling and effective communication of data insights. Understanding how to convey complex information in a clear and compelling manner will be valuable in driving impactful decision-making.
